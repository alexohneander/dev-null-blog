### About Me
My name is Alex Wellnitz and I'm a software developer/DevOps engineer. I'm from Germany, living in Rheinland Pfalz and currently working at ComValue. You can find me on Github, Twitter or on Instagram.

On this page you can find some information about me and a few blog posts I wrote. Most of them are about topics that I'm most interested in, such as gitops, serverless and distributed technologies, or about programming languages like Ruby or Dotnet.
